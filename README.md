## Hello to everyone, Sanu here aka sigmaError

# Here I have a small python script for stock trediction.

This python script will use Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method to predict the closing stock price using past 60 day stock price. Basically, the data, here stock price of Apple Inc. is taken as example, is from yahoo finance. This data, the closed price of the stock is trained and using LSTM model and hence the prediction is determined.

The model looks at past 60 days of data and then gives the prediction accordingly. Below is very simple prediction model python script as a learning project on Machine Learning.
